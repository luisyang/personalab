I tried a lot to learn coding since I was in my junior high school, when computer is seldom seen in China.

The hardest thing in learning a computer language, is English.

When you use a language, make sure the Chinese charactors problem to be solved at the very beginning, or you will drive crazy about the endless warnings or faults.

Like Python, the first line must be UTF-8.
