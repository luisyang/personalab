#Python

Python is a very useful and delight coding language.

Actually, the first coding book I have ever bought is <Programming Collective Intelligence>, written by Toby Segaran, which is an excellent book with Python. However, I did not read and focus on this book until years later when I want to do something with a DNDC program.

So it is the right time since my graduation to learning Python again.
