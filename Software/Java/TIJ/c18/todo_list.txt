TO DO LIST:

*   Create example01

*   Rewrite example03/runclient.sh so that it uses environment variables and the project directories
    __exactly__ like runclient.bat. Then copy the new runclient.sh in all subsequent examples

*   Write example04/runtest.sh as above

*   Replace all catch(Exception) clauses in the EJB implementations with catches for specific exceptions.
    In other words, never use generic exceptions handlers in EJBs.

*   For all examples, write test cases for __all__ methods of the beans in that specific
    example

*   Check that all session beans in tests and clients are disconnected using remove()
    when finished
