Appliances have gone berserk


I can't lock you up


Treading on people's toes


Snot-nosed little punk


And I can't face the evening straight


you can't offer me escape


Houses move and houses speak


If you take me there you'll get relief


Believe, believe, believe, believe...

---

And if I'm gonna talk

I just wanna talk


Please don't interrupt


Just sit back and listen


Cause I can't face the evening straight


you can't offer me escape


Houses move and houses speak


If you take me there you'll get relief


Believe, believe, believe, believe


It's too much


Too bright


Too powerful
