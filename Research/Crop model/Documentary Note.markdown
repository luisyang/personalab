###Assessing nitrogen fertilizer rates and split applications using the DSSAT model for rice irrigated with urban wastewater

>the  Decision  Support  System  for  Agrotechnology  Transfer  (DSSAT)  v4.5  model.  



>assess  the  effect  of  the  nitrogen  (N)  fertilizer  rates  and
split  N  fertilizer  application  on  rice  yields

The  DSSAT  model  was  calibrated  and  validated
with  observed  yield  data  using  the  root  mean  square  error  (RMSE),  normalized  RMSE  (nRMSE),  and  the
**index  of  agreement  (d)**  for  the  statistical  indices.
