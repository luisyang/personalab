###Assessing nitrogen fertilizer rates and split applications using the DSSAT model for rice irrigated with urban wastewater

>**the  Decision  Support  System  for  Agrotechnology  Transfer  (DSSAT)  v4.5  model**.  



>assess  the  effect  of  the  nitrogen  (N)  fertilizer  rates  and
split  N  fertilizer  application  on  rice  yields

>The  DSSAT  model  was  calibrated  and  validated
with  observed  yield  data  using  the  root  mean  square  error  (RMSE),  normalized  RMSE  (nRMSE),  and  the **index  of  agreement  (d)**  for  the  statistical  indices.  

Crop  simulation  models  developed  as  multipurpose  tools  for agricultural  research  **(Suriharn  et  al.,  2011)**  can  be  used  to  simulate  crop  response  to  N  fertilizer  application  (Jang,  2009;  Jeong et  al.,  2011).  Crop  simulation  models,  including  **the  Decision  Support  System  for  Agrotechnology  Transfer  (DSSAT)  model**,  have  been used  successfully  for  studies  that  simulate  crop  growth  and  water use  efficiency  with  different  N  fertilizer  applications  (Nangia  et  al.,
2008b;  Behera  and  Panda,  2009).  **Thorp  et  al.  (2007)  used  the Root  Zone  Water  Quality  Model  linked  with  the  CERES-Maize  plant growth  model  to  quantify  the  long-term  effects  of  different  N  rates on  corn  yield  and  N  dynamics  for  an  agricultural  system**.  Nangia
et  al.  (2008a)  examined  the  maize  yields,  water  productivity,  N  use efficiency,  and  N  leaching  under  different  N  fertilizer  rates  and **split N** fertilizer  application  using  the  DSSAT  model.
